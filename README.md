The EcoFootprint Tracker project provided a comprehensive learning experience in the 
field of web development, focusing on environmental sustainability. Over the course of 
this project, I gained valuable knowledge in designing and developing a responsive, user
friendly web application aimed at helping individuals and organizations measure and 
track their carbon footprint. The platform allows users to input data about their daily 
activities—such as transportation, energy consumption, and lifestyle choices—and 
calculates their carbon emissions.
